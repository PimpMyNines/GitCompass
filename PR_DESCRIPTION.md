# OctoMaster: Python-based GitHub Project Management Tool

## Summary

This pull request implements a comprehensive Python-based GitHub project management tool as outlined in the GITHUB_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md document. OctoMaster replaces the existing bash scripts with a robust Python solution that provides better error handling, cross-platform support, and extends the feature set.

## Changes

- Created a modern Python package structure with modular components
- Implemented core issue management functionality with sub-issue support
- Added project management capabilities with customizable templates
- Created roadmap management through milestones with reporting
- Added comprehensive configuration system (environment variables, config files)
- Implemented detailed documentation and examples
- Added unit tests for core components

## Features

- **Authentication**: Support for GitHub token and App authentication
- **Issue Management**: Create issues, sub-issues, and convert tasks to sub-issues
- **Project Management**: Create and configure projects, manage columns and cards
- **Roadmap Management**: Create milestones and generate roadmap reports
- **CLI & API**: Both command-line and Python API interfaces
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration through multiple sources

## Test Plan

1. Install the package:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:PimpMyNines/github-project-management.git
   cd github-project-management
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Run unit tests:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest
   ```

3. Try the basic CLI commands:
   ```bash
   # Set your GitHub token
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token
   
   # Get version
   octomaster version
   
   # List the help
   octomaster --help
   ```

4. Try creating an issue:
   ```bash
   octomaster issues create --repo your-org/your-repo --title "Test Issue" --body "Testing OctoMaster"
   ```

## Future Work

- Add GitHub Actions integration
- Implement batch operations for multiple repositories
- Add import/export for issue data
- Add visualization for roadmap reports
